This is literally an implementation of the classic game of snake.

It's built in Vanilla JavaScript, edited only in the Chrome browser's debugger.  I discovered I could edit files directly in Chrome one morning and this is the result.

The first thing to note is that I was able to use software patterns to complete this project in a very fast amount of time.  There isn't actually that much code here compared to what it does.  I copy and pasted a bit once certain patterns were established, but if I had more time that would all go away.

The second thing to note is that I didn't use any IDE except the Chrome debugger, any build tools, linters or testing software.  Whether or not I get an interview for this job, I wanted to see how far I've come since my early days when it took me a week to make a simple game.

I also didn't comment as much as normal because this is essentially hobby code.  I made a note or two when I suddenly changed the structure.

To run the code, open it up in the latest Chrome browser.  It's also hosted on https://light-ci.com because that domain was free and I wanted to play with a cool new Go program called Caddy and new Terraform configuration, which I was also playing around with on Sunday.

I kind of cheated a bit, because I made a really nice menu but in the end I didn't have enough items to show off the menu on the opening splash screen, so I tacked on the credits and high score screens after work (Monday, Tuesday'ish).  I also didn't have a death menu by the end of the time on Sunday -- it just said "You accomplished death" in a somewhat rogue-like manner requiring a page refresh.  The rest of the code was made in the appropriate time on Sunday, including the level win menu.  This can be verified with git.

I think it's funny that the actual gameplay only took an hour.  Everything else is menus, and just playing around with different sizes of screens.
